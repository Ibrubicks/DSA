# 📘 LeetCode DSA Practice 

This repo has all the LeetCode problems I've solved so far — around 40. I'm mainly doing this to stay consistent and improve at problem-solving one step at a time.

## ✅ Topics I've Covered

- Arrays
- Strings
- Linked Lists
- Trees (basic stuff)
- Some pattern-based problems like:
  - Two Pointers
  - Sliding Window

I’ve been focusing on problems I actually understand, rather than just grinding blindly.

## 🔜 What’s Next

Planning to start:
- Dynamic Programming 
- Graphs 

Not rushing — trying to build solid basics first.

## 🎯 Goals

- Hit 100+ problems at my own pace
- Be able to solve medium-level questions comfortably
- Keep it clean and organized here so I can track my progress

## 🛠️ Language Used

- **Python only** — just more comfortable with it right now
